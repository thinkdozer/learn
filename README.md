# Learn

Here i created a little learning program for me to practise python programming.
As strategy i used test driven development as well as the state pattern design.
I programmed more of a python library to access weatherdata from Basf Agrarwetter.
The library is capable of getting the current weather for locations in Germany like Berlin or Hannover.
You can just run the weather.py file for trying out how it works.
